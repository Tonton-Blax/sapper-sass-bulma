# Sapper with SASS + BULMA

The default [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template, embedded with bulma, sass and a couple of bulma addons.
That's it.
That's the md.

### hpw to use
Three sass boilerplate files in src/style (one imports bulma sass files, one sets custom variables, one merges the first two).
